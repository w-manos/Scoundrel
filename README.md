# Scoundrel
C Code to play a command line based version of the solitaire game, scoundrel.

Scoundrel is a solitaire game created in 2011 by Zach Gage and Kurt Bieg. It serves as a sort of dungeon crawler game, with clubs and spades functioning as monsters you find in the dungeon, hearts as health potions, and diamonds as weapons you equip to fight with. 

To play the game, compile and run the c code.
